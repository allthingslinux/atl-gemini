## Converter script
- move it from a turing-machine grab line and overwrite approach to a configurable pipeline
- generalize it to work with any markdown document, not just the code of conduct
- add inline link handling
- add support for formatting mdx

## pages
- make the allthingslinux.org homepage randomize the testimonial section with a cgi script instead of being static
- add some sort of landing page for applications, maybe list roles and link out to them
