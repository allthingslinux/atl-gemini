## Converter script
- generalize it to work with any markdown document, not just the code of conduct
- add inline link handling
- add support for formatting mdx
- work on config handling and multiple files/directories
- brand the scg (static capsule generation) framework as ChandraGen, split it off into its own repository when its ready and set up as a submodule

## pages
- make the allthingslinux.org homepage randomize the testimonial section with a cgi script instead of being static
- add some sort of landing page for applications, maybe list roles and link out to them
